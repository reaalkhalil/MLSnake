## Synopsis

This is an implementation of the [SARSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-Action-Reward-State-Action) (state, action, reward, state, action) linear simplification written in JavaScript to play snake. SARSA is a method of reinforcement learning, more information on the linear approximation [here](http://artint.info/html/ArtInt_272.html).

## Usage

There is an `index.html` file to see the snake in action, and a `nobrowser.js` to run using `node.js`.

## Updates

I'll try to add different machine learning algorithms as this doesn't produce very good results, the maximum length it's gotten to isn't much larger than the size of the stage.

I'll also try and do something to optimize the hyperparameters.
